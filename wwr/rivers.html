                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of 
                     No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                     given the nickname long ago as the River of No 
                     Return by the people living near it because of 
                     the number of folks that came to visit and fell 
                     so in love with the rugged beauty of the river 
                     that they never left.
                    
                     Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around 
                     the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly
                     sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe
                      inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy
                       beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from
                        sun or rain when needed.
                    
                     Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class
                     I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed 
                     rivers in the United States. As a free flowing 
                     river the water is higher, faster, and colder in 
                     the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in 
                     the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...
                     but families with children who like to swim tend to
                      appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water
                       more.</p>

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canon, Utah</h2>
                <p>
                    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in 
                    some of the most desolate land anywhere, the 
                    Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado
                     river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
                     beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have 
                     made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs 
                     from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just 
                     outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding 
                     scenery, interesting geologic formations, 
                     evidence of prehistoric and historic human 
                     activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                     Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                     Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
                     This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that 
                     the canyon tells.

                <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the 
                    grand daddy of all river trips. You will never 
                    forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class 
                    whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one 
                    truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon 
                    is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater 
                    rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian
                     ruins accessible only by river.

                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique
                     river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon
                      are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to 
                      accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and 
                      river variances. However, most people are
                       familiar with the regular I - V river rating 
                       scale, so we often refer to both.
