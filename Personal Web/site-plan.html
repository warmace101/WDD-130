      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>ASD is a website that has been designed to help bring people together in these hard times.  ASD stands for Anxiety, Stress, and Depression.  
        The reason behind this website is to help others to come together either anonymously or not.  To have people know that they are not alone and that 
        everyone goes through rough patches and hard times.  Sometimes it is hard to get out what we are feeling and sometimes we just end up bottling it up 
        deep down inside.  Both of those are serious problems that we all must overcome to get onto the road of happiness and healing.  Whether you are in a 
        weird funk or just needing to read something to let you know that you are not alone.  ASD is the website that is here for everyone no matter where you 
        come from or your age.  Whether you are a newly couple struggling to find ways to communicate to your spouse or significant other.  Whether you are
         under a lot of stress from work, or a relative has sadly passed away.  I invite everyone to come to this website to talk about what is on your chest
          and to finally get that burden off of you by coming to this website and involve yourself on this website.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>ADS, Anxiety, Stress, Derpession, is a website for everyone, becuase everyone has anxiety, stress, and depression.  No matter what the reason or if you are just needing to see that you are not alone in this world.  Since the pandemic has started, people have had more anxiety and stress, from what I have been noticing in my part of the small world. I thought that for some of them that it would help them if they got it off of their chests and out of their mind by talking about it.  But no one wants to look like they are the needy one or the one that looks like they have more problems.  Hence why I have made this website for people to be able to get what ever they need off of their chest and out of their minds.</p>  <!-- change this -->

                  ASD
          Intro
            Anxiety, Stress, and Depression.  All of these emotions and feelings hit us all in very different ways.  Some people deal with these emotions very well, and others have 
            a very hard time trying to recover or get out of these feelings.
          Reasoning
            I have made this website to help out with peoples anxiety, stress, and depression.  The reason why is because I struggle with these emotions as well, and it is hard 
            trying to stop feeling these emotions.  I have been the firm pillar because of how I deal with these emotions in my family and it has helped me and my family survive 
            through the pandemic and it’s not easy to be that firm pillar to support others when you are feeling all of these emotions.  
          Explanation
            ASD is just an open public website where people can post and be able to talk about what they are feeling.  My goal is to try to make this available to everyone.  If 
            everyone had access to website seeking guidance through the hard times or just wanting to get something off of their chest then they can do so without having to reveal
             who they are.  Completely anonymous.  The reason for that is because some people don’t want to let anyone know what they are going through, even if that is what they 
             are needing to do.  They can come to the website and talk with others if they want or they can just get whatever they need to off of their chest and walk away.
            ASD is supposed to be a tool to help people get out of their “funks” or “lows” so that they can get back on to their feet happy and not have to worry about not being 
            able to find advice without being judged or criticized for being a little stressed or anxious through the day.
          The Why’s
            People will ask, “Why is there a website for this kind of stuff and not go to a doctor?”  Well, some people aren’t able to feel comfortable outside of their home with 
            these kind of problems.  They want to stay in their safe zones and not leave them if they can help it.  This website isn’t meant to be a quick fix.  It takes time to
             get out of these feelings and sometimes it can take forever and sometimes it can be pretty quick.  But the first step is to get them to either talk about their feelings or to get them to just talk and have someone listen to their story or their feelings.  I am no doctor so all of my observations has been through my own experience and I have found that just getting someone to talk and having them feel comfortable enough to talk to you is very helpful to them and to the person who is listening, because you have just made them feel probably ten times better than what they were feeling before they talked to you.  
            My brother and my wife have bad anxiety and bad depression.  Learning how to listen to them was extremely hard, because it is not just listening to their story.  You
             need to listen to their story, their body language, and try to sense how they are feeling when they are talking to you.  I am still learning how to read their emotions
              and their body language and it is very difficult.  The slightest head nod or the smallest of twitches in their face or hands is a signal saying “Look I am nervous”,
              and that they are trying to hold back info.  If that is the case then the listener needs to let it happen on it’s own time.  The person who is struggling will eventually
               talk to you and tell you what is wrong.
          Conclusion
            ASD is supposed to help people with their “lows” and “funks”, and to help people be more comfortable to talk about their feelings openly to others and to not withhold any 
            info that could be really important to someone that could give advice because they were feeling the exact same way you are feeling at that moment.

      <h3>ASD Blog</h3>
      <p>
        Here is the link to openly talk about what you are feeling.  If you want to talk about it with others or just want to read what some people are going through.  We are all 
        in this together and people shouldn't need to feel alone in this.  There are so many people that are probably thinking the same way you are, and the only reason why you feel alone 
        is because no one likes to talk about what they are feeling or expressing how they are feeling.  You don't need to feel alone.  No one should feel like they are alone because 
        there are so many people on this planet that are probably feeling exactly the same as you are.  Please take a moment and think about what you are feeling and then ask yourself
        "Why do I feel like this?".  After that question your answer was probably like "Because I don't feel loved." or "No one cares so why should I?"  Let me ask you another question. 
        "Do you think that others in other countries feel the same as you?"

      <h3>About ASD</h3>
      <p>
        Here is the about why this Website has been created.  Several people have been having many struggles recently.  Some people have been so depressed that they don't want
        to do anything with anyone.  Some people have been stressed out to the point of their mental health will either shatter like a light bulb or the damn breaks and all 
        of the water just comes flowing out in one giant concentrated leak until the pressure builds up to the point of almost flooding the river down below.  People are not 
        meant to hold in all of these emotions and it is hard to find an escape or someone to vent to.  ASD is here as a tool to help people vent or escape from their own
        stresses and things that have been making us all go into a weird funk.  We all go through rough patches and we all need to talk about all of our emotions off of our
        chest.
